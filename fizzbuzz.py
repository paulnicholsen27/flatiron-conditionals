# With a partner, loop through the integers from 1 to 100.  (the range function and a for-loop will be helpful)  
# If the integer is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz".  If the integer is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"  If it is a
# multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".  Otherwise, print the number itself.
